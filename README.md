# Local Address DNS Client (RPi)

## What is this?
This is a web service (written in NodeJS) that responds with a JSON result containing your devices IP address on a **local** network interface.

This is used by [local-address-dns](https://github.com/jordancrawfordnz/local-address-dns). local-address-dns is run on an internet facing (IP address known) server. You don't always know the IP address your Raspberry Pi will be assigned on your local network (and don't always have access to / can be bother with MAC based DHCP assignments). local-address-dns turns a DNS entry like ``local.pi.example.com`` into your local IP address.

Your Pi must be accessable from the internet facing machine, such as via a VPN connection. local-address-dns-client-rpi runs on your Pi to provide your IP address to local-address-dns. local-address-dns runs a DNS server that responds with the local address of the Pi.

## Building
Build with ``docker build -t jordancrawford/local-address-dns-client-rpi .``.

## Running
Run with ``docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --restart always --name local-address-dns-client --net=host jordancrawford/local-address-dns-client-rpi [interface]``

Fill in interface with the network interface that you would like to get the IP address for (e.g.: ``eth0``). Use ``ifconfig`` to list all your available interfaces.
